### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! I am Muhammad Moiz, a development engineer with a passion for building all kinds of awesome stuff, from cool hardware projects like automatic light systems to clever software solutions like an app that creates custom memes of your friends using their photos. I'm a lifelong learner who believes that personal growth is key to success, so I am always on the lookout for exciting new challenges and opportunities to expand my skills and knowledge in the field of AI and robotics. Let's make some amazing things together!

#### ðŸ”­ What I'm currently working on

- **Meeting Summarization: **
It's an app that converts audio into written transcripts, automatically highlighting key points covered and actionable items to help you quickly get to the most important information.

- **Privacy-aware person detection and tracking: **
It employs YOLOv8 for object detection, ByteTrack for object tracking, and a subnetwork to mask out faces, ensuring privacy and security.

- **AIM bot: **
It's an aimbot for CS:GO that leverages object detection to identify enemy players, resulting in the perfect headshot every time.

#### ðŸŒ± What I'm currently learning

- Docker
- ROS2
- Stable Diffusion

#### ðŸ’¬ Ask me about

- Machine Learning
- UAVs
- Automation

#### ðŸ¤” I'm looking for help with

- Developing machine learning applications specifically for Android.

#### âš¡ Fun fact

While I may not have the ability to pilot a drone myself, I excel in creating drones that fly on their own, showing off my impressive skills in robotics and programming. From autonomous delivery drones to drones that can capture stunning aerial footage, I'm your go-to person for all things drone-related. Let's take to the skies!### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
